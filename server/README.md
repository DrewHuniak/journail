## What is the name of your App?
Journail

<br /><br />
## What does your app do?
We are making a journal that will create journal entries via a conversation with an LLM and use text summarisation to create more concise journal entries from these conversations. The system would store an embeddings vector database of past journal entries to be able to bring in context relevant to the current conversation so it can get to know the user, and help them have a personalized conversation to get in touch with themself and organize their inner thoughts. Users would also be able ask questions about their journal, such as when the last time they saw a certain person was, which would utilize a combination of keyword search and embedding search to answer the question and reference specific entries.
